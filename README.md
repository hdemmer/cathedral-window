Demo: Cathedral Window
======================

Inspired by the beautiful window roses of French cathedrals. Done in OpenGL ES 2. Shows random images from your device's library. Images are from Google and used for demo purposes only. Since I have no developer certs handy, I don't know how it performs on device :(
